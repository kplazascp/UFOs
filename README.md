# UFOs
## Overview
In this challenge, we are helping Dana by bubilding a dinamic web page, which will accept user inputs and filter the results.
We are going to do this, by inserting Javascript into an HTML page were we will see UFO Sightings.

## Results
The web page was divided in 2 sections:
For the first section We will find:
![HTML_UFO1](https://github.com/kplazascp/UFOs/blob/main/static/UFO_HTML.PNG)

- the index "UFO Sigtinghs"
- the Title: "The trith is out there" with the image as the background from de Nasa.
- The content where, at the left you can find: "UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy? Ufologist weight in"
- Article of content where we can find the different quotes from Ufologists

For the seconnd section we can find the table with the data and the 5 filters we have created:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

All of these filters can be used by the final user to be able to search for a specific Date, City, State, Country or Shape. The filters can also be deleted and all the information will return to its original display.
For example, in this image we are filtering data from "1/10/2010" and State = "ma":

## Summary
One drawback of the new design is that the final user has to know what is written in the data to be able to filter it, this can be improved by having a dropdown filter with categories so that the final user chooses the category in which want to dive deep instead of writing something that probably isn't in the data.
Gor the second recommendation, we can also add a button to clear all filters at once, this is useful and helpful to the final user so that, in the case that the user filtered all 5 filters, it can erase them easily.
